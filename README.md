# Box Office Analysis for Microsoft Studios


## Overview

Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio. Our aim is to guide the newly founded Microsoft Studios in what kind of films they should focus on. We have analyzed historical data (focusing on cost and revenue) for both movies and directors in order to measure success and to discover any insights that may help guide Microsoft Studios to succeed and become the next film industry giant.

## Business Problem

In order for Microsoft to be successful, box office films were analyzed to see the contributing factors that make a film successful. These factors were then leveraged to create actionable recommendations for the head of Microsoft Studios to guide their decision-making in determining what type of films to create.

## Hypothesis

1. There is an optimal time in the year to release a film.
2. Certain directors have higher grossing films when compared to other directors.
3. There are certain genres that are the more profitable when compared to others.

## Analysis Focus

1. Our analysis will focus on movies from 2010 - 2018.
2. Explore which films are succeeding at the box office.
3. Advise and provide recommendations to ensure that Microsoft Studios' films are successful.


## Recommendations

In order for Microsoft's new studio to be successful, we recommend the following:

1. Release a movie during the Summer. The data shows movies released during the summertime generate the most overall revenue, resulting in a higher ROI. This could suggest that warm weather encourages consumers to get out of the house and spend money. But the data defiantly says that releasing a movie in the Summer generates the most overall revenue.
2. We can conclude that there is a range of directors that have a higher average domestic gross and a higher average international gross. If Microsoft Studios is in search for a director for a new film, the studio should choose from this list, dependent on audience (domestic vs international), and can increase the likelihood that the film will have a strong box office performance.
3. Genre based on budget:
      - Adventure, Fantasy and Science Fiction genres offer high flexibility in budget
        - (20M - 165M) budget range
      - Western and War genres offer less flexibility in budget
        - (13M - 65M) budget range
      - Mystery and Music genres offer even lower flexible in budget.
        - (5M - 45M) budget range
